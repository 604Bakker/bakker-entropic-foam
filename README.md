Emergent Topological Chiral Index in Causal-Set Dirac-Kähler Fermions Random 2+1D causal sets + DK fermions + CS parity bias + Wilson doubler removal → saturated chiral index (80 zero modes, uniform chirality) when r ≳ 0.2. No gauge group or Higgs by hand. Index from geometry + topology alone. Full (r × ε × N) phase-space logs, data, code.
