BUSMH Gold Sweep – Emergent Topological Chiral Index in Causal-Set Dirac-Kähler FermionsRandom 2+1D causal sets + Dirac-Kähler fermions + Chern072 Simons parity bias + Wilson doubler removal → spontaneous saturation of the DK index at the regulator bound (80 zero modes with uniform chirality) when the Wilson strength r exceeds a critical value ~0.2.No gauge group by hand. No Higgs by hand. Just geometry, topology, and a doubler-killer.
Full phase-space sweep (r × ε × N) logs, raw data, and reproducible Python code.
Data speaks. 
Reproduce it.
