\begin{abstract}
In random 2+1D causal sets equipped with Dirac--Kähler fermions, a Chern--Simons-like parity term combined with a Wilson doubler-removal operator produces a sharp, reproducible transition in the spectral chiral index. Above a critical Wilson strength $r_c \approx 0.2$, the index jumps from zero to the regulator maximum ($+80$) and remains saturated across a wide range of the Chern--Simons coupling $\varepsilon$. This corresponds to 80 exact zero modes of identical chirality. No gauge group or Higgs field is introduced by hand; the chiral asymmetry arises purely from oriented triangles in the random geometry and the lifting of fermion doublers. Full phase-space data ($r \times \varepsilon \times N$) and reproducible code are publicly available at the URL above.

\section{Introduction}
Chiral gauge structure is imposed by hand in the Standard Model and remains unexplained in most quantum gravity approaches. Causal-set theory offers a non-perturbative, background-independent discretisation of spacetime \citep{Bombelli1987,Sorkin2003}. Dirac--Kähler fermions on simplicial complexes provide a natural, metric-independent discretisation \citep{Becher1982,Rabin1982}, but suffer from exact fermion doubling on unstructured graphs \citep{Sorkin1986}. In 2+1 dimensions, oriented triangles permit a discrete analogue of a Chern--Simons term \citep{Sorkin1991}. Here we show numerically that the combination of a standard Wilson term and this discrete Chern--Simons term is sufficient to induce a large, stable chiral index without any explicit gauge or scalar fields.

\section{Model}
The spacetime is a random 2+1D causal set generated by Poisson sprinkling. The Dirac--Kähler operator $D$ is constructed from incidence matrices on 0-, 1-, and 2-forms \citep{DeWitt1979}. The Wilson term is $r (D D^\dagger + D^\dagger D)$. The parity-violating term is
\[
S_{\mathrm{CS}} = \varepsilon \sum_{\triangle} \sigma_{\triangle},
\]
where $\sigma_{\triangle} = \pm 1$ is the orientation of each triangle. The chiral index is the eigenvalue asymmetry in the lowest $K=80$ modes:
\[
\mathrm{Index} = n_+ - n_-,
\]
with $n_\pm$ counting modes satisfying $|\lambda| < 10^{-6}$.

\section{Numerical Results}

\caption{Chiral index phase diagram from the full sweep. The index is zero for $r < r_c \approx 0.2$ (doublers protect symmetry). Above $r_c$ the index saturates at the regulator bound $+80$ for all $\varepsilon$ above a critical value that decreases with $r$. Data averaged over 8 bootstrap realizations per point.}

Key findings:
\begin{itemize}
\item $r = 0.0$: index = 0 for all $\varepsilon$ (doublers cancel the CS term).
\item $r \ge 0.2$: sharp transition to saturated index = +80 with 80 zero modes of uniform chirality.
\item Saturation persists across the full $\varepsilon$ range.
\item Critical onset $\varepsilon_c \approx 0.14$--0.16 for $N=100$.
\end{itemize}

\section{Interpretation}
The Wilson term lifts the doubler degeneracy that previously enforced spectral symmetry. Once lifted, the discrete Chern--Simons term biases the vacuum toward maximal chiral asymmetry. The saturation at $K=80$ and its stability suggest a spectral-flow mechanism analogous to the 2+1D parity anomaly \citep{Redlich1984}. Whether the index grows with volume or remains regulator-fixed is under investigation.
